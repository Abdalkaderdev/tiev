# Plan 01-02: Update Footer with TIEV Branding

## Goal

Replace SoapBox branding in the Footer with TIEV identity, update links to match new site structure, and add relevant social media/contact information.

## Why This Matters

The Footer provides site-wide navigation, legal links, and brand reinforcement. Updating it completes the branding phase and ensures consistent TIEV identity across all pages.

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Replace SoapBox brand section with TIEV branding
  - File: `components/Footer.tsx`
  - Change: Replace logo, "SoapBox Super App" text, and description with TIEV mission statement
  - Lines: 9-19

- [x] 2. Update "Features" section to "Our Work" or "Projects"
  - File: `components/Footer.tsx`
  - Change: Replace feature links with project pages (Iraq, Pakistan, Philippines, Japan)
  - Lines: 22-32

- [x] 3. Update "Company" section to "About"
  - File: `components/Footer.tsx`
  - Change: Keep About, Contact; remove FAQ/Help/Support or update as needed
  - Lines: 35-44

- [x] 4. Update "Legal" and "Get Started" sections
  - File: `components/Footer.tsx`
  - Change: Keep Privacy/Terms, replace Sign Up/Sign In with Donate link
  - Lines: 47-60

- [x] 5. Update copyright and tagline
  - File: `components/Footer.tsx`
  - Change: "TIEV Global" copyright, update tagline to match mission
  - Lines: 64-71

- [ ] 6. Add social media links (optional)
  - File: `components/Footer.tsx`
  - Change: Add Instagram, Facebook, or other social links if available
  - Lines: New section or integrate into existing
  - Status: Deferred (no social URLs provided)

## Verification

- [x] Footer displays "TIEV" branding with mission-appropriate icon
- [x] Project links: Iraq, Pakistan, Philippines, Japan
- [x] Company links: About, Contact
- [x] Legal links: Privacy, Terms (can remain as placeholders)
- [x] Donate link prominent
- [x] Copyright shows "TIEV Global" and current year
- [x] No console errors or TypeScript issues
- [x] Visual consistency maintained (amber accents, dark theme)
