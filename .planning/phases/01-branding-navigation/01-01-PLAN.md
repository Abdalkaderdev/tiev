# Plan 01-01: Update Navbar with TIEV Branding

## Goal

Replace SoapBox branding in the Navbar with TIEV identity and update navigation links for the missionary organization's site structure.

## Why This Matters

The Navbar is the primary navigation element visible on every page. Updating it first establishes TIEV's brand identity and enables navigation to all new pages as they're built.

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Replace SoapBox logo/icon with TIEV branding
  - File: `components/Navbar.tsx`
  - Change: Replace `Flame` icon and "SoapBox" text with TIEV logo (globe/heart icon) and "TIEV" text
  - Lines: 28-33

- [x] 2. Update navLinks array with TIEV navigation structure
  - File: `components/Navbar.tsx`
  - Change: Replace current links with: Home, About, Projects (dropdown or single), Donate, Contact
  - Lines: 14-21

- [x] 3. Update CTA button text and destination
  - File: `components/Navbar.tsx`
  - Change: Replace "Get Started" with "Donate" or "Support Us", link to `/donate`
  - Lines: 54-60, 106-114

- [x] 4. Adjust mobile menu to match new navigation
  - File: `components/Navbar.tsx`
  - Change: Mobile menu uses same navLinks, will auto-update, verify styling
  - Lines: 80-115

- [x] 5. Remove unused icon imports, add new icons if needed
  - File: `components/Navbar.tsx`
  - Change: Remove `Flame`, `Sparkles` if unused; add `Globe`, `Heart`, or custom TIEV icon
  - Lines: 6

## Verification

- [x] Navbar displays "TIEV" branding with appropriate icon
- [x] Navigation links: Home, About, Projects, Donate, Contact
- [x] CTA button says "Donate" and links to `/donate`
- [x] Mobile menu works correctly with new links
- [x] No console errors or TypeScript issues
- [x] Visual consistency maintained (amber accents, dark theme)

## Files Modified

- `components/Navbar.tsx`

## Depends On

Nothing (first plan)

## Notes

- Keep the floating pill-shaped navbar design
- Maintain hover effects and active state styling
- Preserve mobile responsiveness
- Consider adding a "Projects" dropdown later if needed (can be single link for now)
