## Objective
Create the Iraq Project page.

## Changes Made

    - **Hero**: "Rebuilding Faith in the Cradle of Civilization" title, with amber glow.
    - **Overview**: Text describing the context and TIEV's approach.
    - **Stats**: 4 impact metrics (Churches, Baptisms, Centers, Families).
    - **Initiatives**: 3 SpotlightCards detailing House Churches, Leader Training, and Refugee Care.
    - **CTA**: "Partner with Iraq" section linking to `/donate`.

## Verification Results
