Output: New home page with TIEV hero section replacing SoapBox content.

**Tech stack available:** Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, lucide-react
**Established patterns:** Large page components, inline data arrays, JSX section comments
**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 1: Used Globe icon for TIEV branding, Heart icon for Donate, kept amber/gold colors

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Replace hero content with TIEV messaging</name>
  <files>app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Replace the existing SoapBox hero section (lines ~108-175) with TIEV missionary content:

1. Update badge text from "Faith Community Platform" to "Global Missions"
2. Change headline from "Unite Your Faith with SoapBox" to:
   - "Reaching the Unreached"
   - "Caring for the Poor"
3. Update description to TIEV's mission: "Discovering the treasure found in every Nation, Tribe and Tongue. Join us in discipleship, church planting, and transforming communities across Iraq, Pakistan, Philippines, and Japan."
4. Replace CTA buttons:
   - Primary: "Support Our Mission" linking to /donate (use Heart icon)
   - Secondary: "Explore Our Work" linking to /projects
5. Update footer text from "Join thousands of faith communities" to "Serving across the 10/40 window since [year]"
6. Keep the animated background, glow orbs, and SVG visualization - just update text/links

Use Globe icon in place of Flame where appropriate. Keep amber-400/amber-500 color scheme.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, visually inspect hero displays TIEV content</verify>
  <done>Hero section shows TIEV branding, mission statement, correct CTAs linking to /donate and /projects</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Clean up unused SoapBox data arrays</name>
  <files>app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Remove or comment out the SoapBox-specific data arrays at the top of the file that won't be used:
- digitalMinistryFeatures (SoapBox features)
- whyChooseUs (SoapBox benefits)
- oraFeatures (ORA AI features)
- oraPowers (ORA powers)
- steps (SoapBox onboarding)

Keep the imports clean - remove unused icons (Flame, Mic, Video, etc.) but keep those needed for TIEV (Globe, Heart, ArrowRight, Users, etc.).

Note: We'll add TIEV-specific data arrays in subsequent plans. For now, just clean up what's not needed.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, no TypeScript errors about unused variables</verify>
  <done>Unused SoapBox data arrays removed, imports cleaned up, no build errors</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Remove SoapBox sections below hero</name>
  <files>app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Remove all SoapBox-specific sections below the hero:
- "Digital Ministry Features" section
- "Why Choose Us" section
- "ORA" AI assistant section
- "How to Get Started" steps section
- "LogoMarquee" component usage
- Any other SoapBox-specific content

Leave the hero section and the basic page structure. The page should have:
- Hero section (updated in Task 1)
- Empty space where we'll add TIEV sections in subsequent plans (02-02 and 02-03)

This creates a clean slate for TIEV-specific content while preserving the hero.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, page loads with only hero section visible</verify>
  <done>Page contains only TIEV hero section, all SoapBox sections removed, builds successfully</done>
</task>
